NAME
      rmshit - keep a directory structure clean at all times

SYNOPSIS
      rmshit [OPTION]

DESCRIPTION
    rmshit was born out of plain rage and frustation, seeing that nobody
    seems to care about the XDG specifications, and dumping configuration
    files, temporary data and logs straight into $HOME.

    Even if you manually delete these files, they will be recreated when the
    Application of Sin wants to (when it's executed, seeing default data is
    missing, for example).

    The most well known application that does this, as of this writing, is
    Mozilla Firefox, creating $HOME/Desktop, over and over again.

    rmshit uses inotify to keep an eye on a directory structure, instantly
    removing data upon it's creation.

OPTIONS
      -c, --clean   clean dir(s) of unwanted files and exit
      -l, --lastlog show the last n number of removed files (default: 25)
      -k, --kill    kill a running rmshit process
      -h, --help    this help
      -m, --man     manpage

ENVIRONMENT
    rmshit watches the directories you specify in the configuration file. It
    should be placed in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rmshit/rmshit.conf or
    $HOME/.config/rmshit/rmshit.conf.

    The log file will be placed in $XDG_DATA_HOME/rmshit/rmshit.log. Entries
    will look like this:

    [* FILE] 2010-07-18 07:19:26: /home/scp1/.fehrc

    [* DIR] 2010-07-18 07:20:02: /home/scp1/Desktop

    [ FILE] 2010-07-18 07:20:02: /home/scp1/.craprc

    The '*' indicates the file was already present when rmshit was started.
